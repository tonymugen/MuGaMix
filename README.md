This is an R package to assign individuals to populations based on phenotypic data from multiple traits. It uses Bayesian inference and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to fit the model. Goodness of fit is assessed using Bayes factors which allow to choose the most likely number of populations.

To install, make sure you have the `devtools` package on your system, and then run `install_github("tonymugen/MuGaMix")`. It should work under any Unix-like system, but has not been tested under Windows.
